All samples labeled "placenta" or "placental disc" are termed "chorionic villi" in the manuscript.

All samples were run in replicate; viral loads are displayed as the average of the replicate.

The QRT-PCR assay has a quality control standard for positive samples. Only positive samples in runs that passed quality control are displayed in the portal. All negative samples are displayed regardless of the quality control status.

If one replicate tested positive, and one sample tested negative, the sample is labeled "Equivocal."

Samples listed as "equivocal" are not used in statistical analysis, regardless if the run passed quality control or not.

If sample that previously tested as "equivocal" was tested again, only the non-equivocal value was used; if sample that previously tested as equivocal was not tested again, no value was used.

Some samples were tested multiple times; for samples that were not equivocal, the values of the multiple tests were averaged. 

Some samples were tested multiple times, but none of the runs in which the sample was tested passed quality control. In this case, the raw data from the failed quality control runs were imported into this spreadsheet and the values were averaged to determine a viral load. Samples not in the Labkey Open Research portal are highlighted in yellow 

There is currently no empirically-derived limit of detection for our assay. A theoretical limit of detection has been calculated at 3 copies/miligram of tissue.

All samples that tested positive above 0.1 are displayed in figure 5, however, only samples >3 copies/mg were used for statistical calculations.
