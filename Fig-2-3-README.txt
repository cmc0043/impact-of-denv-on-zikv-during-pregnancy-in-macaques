Participant filters: 044-101;044-102;044-103;044-104;042-101;042-102;042-103;042-104;042-105;042-106;042-107;042-108

All samples were run in replicate; viral loads are displayed as the average of the replicate.

The QRT-PCR assay has a quality control standard for positive samples. Only positive samples in runs that passed quality control are displayed in the portal. All negative samples are displayed regardless of the quality control status.

If one replicate tested positive, and one sample tested negative, the sample is labeled "Equivocal."

Samples listed as "equivocal" are not used in statistical analysis, regardless if the run passed quality control or not.

If sample that previously tested as "equivocal" was tested again, only the non-equivocal value was used; if sample that previously tested as equivocal was not tested again, no value was used.

Some samples were tested multiple times; for samples that were not equivocal, the values of the multiple tests were averaged. 

The limit of quantification for the QRT-PCR assay is 100 copies/mL. 

All samples that tested positive above the limit of detection are displayed in figure 2 and only samples >100 copies/mL were used for statistical calculations (duration, area under the curve). 

Raw data, including samples below the limit of detection, are included in this spreadsheet.
